                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subject I learned
                        were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly
                        feel I got every penny's worth.

                        " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
                        looking to make a transition and have some people whi has an amazing
                        experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
                        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
                        the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                        course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
                        at a VR startup. "

                        " Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some
                        structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                        I was encouraged to enroll by a formal student of their who can only say wonderful
                        things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
                        very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                        particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                        could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interview as an example of my
                        development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                        multiple offers. 100% recommended! "
